## 📖 About This Project

Leaph is a **learning-focused implementation** of a Virtual Machine-based code obfuscator for Luau. It demonstrates:

- **VM architecture design** with custom bytecode and execution
- **Multi-layer encryption** strategies  
- **Anti-debugging techniques** in interpreter design
- **Educational philosophy** through intentional learning challenges

**⚠️ Note**: This is **educational material**, not production-ready code.  
Bugs and limitations are part of the learning experience.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

| Area | What You'll Explore |
|------|---------------------|
| **VM Design** | Register-based VM architecture, instruction sets, bytecode format |
| **Bytecode Execution** | Instruction decoding, runtime interpretation, state management |
| **Encryption Layers** | XOR chains, permutation, custom base encoding, key derivation |
| **Protection Strategies** | Anti-debugging, environment detection, runtime integrity checks |
| **System Architecture** | Modular design, component interfaces, error handling patterns |

## 📚 Documentation

### [🧠 Philosophy](philosophy.md)
Why this exists: Educational purpose, anti-gatekeeping stance, and learning approach.

### [🏗️ Architecture Overview](architecture.md) *(Coming Soon)*
Technical design: VM structure, bytecode format, encryption layers.

### [🐛 Learning Challenges](challenges.md) *(Coming Soon)*
Intentional "bugs" and what they teach about system design.

## 🧩 The Learning Approach

This project follows **"constructive frustration"** pedagogy:

1. **Study the architecture** - Understand the VM design patterns
2. **Identify the challenges** - Find intentional implementation gaps  
3. **Debug and fix** - Learn by solving real problems
4. **Extend and improve** - Apply understanding to create better versions

**The goal isn't to use this code—it's to understand it, critique it, fix it, and learn why VM obfuscation works the way it does.**
